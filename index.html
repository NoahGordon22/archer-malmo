		<h2>Our trip</h2>
		<p>We started by leave on Friday the 8th of Dec. 2017 at around 9 a.m. We the rode the bus to downtown Memphis and got off at "The Cotton Exchange Muesum. Nect we traveled to the floor in which the company owned and were going to give us a tour on. Once we had arived there we all sat and they the workers of Archer Malmo start speeking. <a href="#topic">(What they talked about) </a> After talking they showed us all the floors they owned and what they are used for.</p>
		<p>After all of this we were hungry and wanted to eat so we got on the bus and headed out. We travel through Memphis to "The Cookout" and when we got there we filled up the building. We had enough people to wrap around the entire inside of the store. Once everyone had finish eating we got back on the bus and head back to the school campus so that we coul return to class. :( But overall it was a fun trip. We even let Mrs. SinClair in the back of the bus with the kool cids because it was her first time on a school bus and on a school feild trip.</p>
